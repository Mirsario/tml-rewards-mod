# Rewards

This mod rewards players for game progression with Progress Points; a spendable, non-transferable currency to purchase rare, hard-to-grind items to speed up the game. Consult the Wayfarer town npc for spending options (note that more purchases are unlocked as you progress the game).

See the [Hamstar's Helpers](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/hamstars-mods-past-present-and-future.63713/) Control Panel for configuration options (including shop items).
